# MDACA PrivateGPT - Solution Accelerator
## Unleash the Power of Azure Open AI or Open AI APIs with your Private Content

ChatGPT has grown explosively in popularity as we all know now. Business users across the globe often tap into the public service to work more productively or act as a creative assistant.

However, ChatGPT risks exposing confidential intellectual property. One option is to block corporate access to ChatGPT, but people always find workarounds. This also limits the powerful capabilities of ChatGPT and reduces employee productivity and their work experience.

MDACA PrivateGPT is our enterprise option. This is the exact same service but offered as your private ChatGPT.

### Benefits are:

**1. Private:** Built-in guarantees around the privacy of your data and fully isolated from those operated by OpenAI.

**2. Controlled:** Network traffic can be fully isolated to your network and other enterprise grade security controls are built in.

**3. Value:** Deliver added business value with your own internal data sources (plug and play) or use plug-ins to integrate with your internal services (e.g., ServiceNow, etc).

**4. Knowledge Stores:** Ask questions over hundreds of pages or you own content and webpages.

We've built a Solution Accelerator to empower your workforce with MDACA PrivateGPT.

# üìò Prerequisites

1. [Azure OpenAI](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/cognitive-services/openai-service/): To deploy and run ChatGPT on Azure, you'll need an Azure subscription with access to the Azure OpenAI service. Request access [here](https://customervoice.microsoft.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR7en2Ais5pxKtso_Pz4b1_xUOFA5Qk1UWDRBMjg0WFhPMkIzTzhKQ1dWNyQlQCN0PWcu). Once you have access, follow the instructions in this [link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/how-to/create-resource?pivots=web-portal) to deploy the gpt-35-turbo or gpt-4 models.
**or** 
   [OpenAI APIs](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api): To run directly against the OpenAI APIs, you'll need to acquire an API key.
2. Setup Keycloak for Authentication:
   The [Setup the identity provider](#add-an-identity-provider) section below shows how to configure authentication providers.
3. Setup ChromaDB as a Vectorstore:
   ChromaDB should be running in client/server mode and available at localhost:8000 to utilize knowledge stores.

   üí°Note: You can configure the authentication provider to your identity solution using [NextAuth providers](https://next-auth.js.org/providers/)

# üëãüèª Introduction

MDACA PrivateGPT is built with the following technologies.

[Node.js 18](https://nodejs.org/en): an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment.

[Next.js 13](https://nextjs.org/docs): enables you to create full-stack web applications by extending the latest React features

[NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/): configurable authentication framework for Next.js 13

[LangChain JS](https://www.langchain.com/): AI orchestration layer to build intelligent apps

[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): is a utility-first CSS framework that provides a series of predefined classes that can be used to style each element by mixing and matching

[shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/): re-usable components built using Radix UI and Tailwind CSS.

# üíô One click AWS Marketplace Deployment

[Deploy in AWS using the Marketplace AMI](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-oatdhswgh2f4u)

Deploy the AMI and get setup using the quick launch guide: https://mdaca.io/support/documentation/privategpt/launch-guide/

Please see the [section below](#ü™™-add-an-identity-provider) for important information about adding authentication to your app.

# üë®üèª‚Äçüíª Run from your local machine

Clone this repository locally or fork to your Github account. Run all of the the steps below from the "src" directory.

1. Create a new file named `.env.local` to store the environment variables add the following variables

   ```
   - azure-open-ai-accelerator
   # azure open ai related configurations
   AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=
   AZURE_OPENAI_API_INSTANCE_NAME=
   AZURE_OPENAI_API_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=
   AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION=

   # github OAuth app configuration
   AUTH_GITHUB_ID=
   AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET=

   # Azure AD OAuth app configuration
   AZURE_AD_CLIENT_ID=
   AZURE_AD_CLIENT_SECRET=
   AZURE_AD_TENANT_ID=

   # when deploying to production, set the NEXTAUTH_URL environment variable to the canonical URL of your site. https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/options

   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=
   NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
   ```

2. Install npm packages by running `npm install`
3. Start the project by running `npm run dev`

You should now be prompted to login with GitHub. Once you successfully login, you can start creating new conversations.

# ‚òÅÔ∏è Deploy to Azure - GitHub Actions

### üß¨ Fork the repository

Fork this repository to your own organisation so that you can execute GitHub Actions against your own Azure Subscription.

### üóùÔ∏è Configure secrets in your GitHub repository

### 1. AZURE_CREDENTIALS

The GitHub workflow requires a secret named AZURE_CREDENTIALS to authenticate with Azure. The secret contains the credentials for a service principal with the Contributor role on the resource group containing the container app and container registry.

1. Create a service principal with the Contributor role on the resource group that contains the Azure App Service.

   ```
   az ad sp create-for-rbac
      --name <NAME OF THE CREDENTIAL> --role contributor --scopes /subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION ID>/resourceGroups/<RESOURCE GROUP> --sdk-auth --output json
   ```

2. Copy the JSON output from the command.

3. In the GitHub repository, navigate to Settings > Secrets > Actions and select New repository secret.

4. Enter AZURE_CREDENTIALS as the name and paste the contents of the JSON output as the value.

5. Select Add secret.

# ü™™ Add an identity provider

Once the deployment is complete, you will need to add an identity provider to authenticate your app.

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Only one of the identity provider is required below.

## GitHub Authentication provider

We'll create two GitHub apps: one for testing locally and another for production.

### üü° Development app setup

1. Navigate to GitHub OAuth Apps setup https://github.com/settings/developers
2. Create a `New OAuth App` https://github.com/settings/applications/new
3. Fill in the following details

```
Application name: Azure ChatGPT DEV Environment
Homepage URL:http://localhost:3000/
Authorization callback URL:http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/github/
```

### üü¢ Production app setup

1. Navigate to GitHub OAuth Apps setup https://github.com/settings/developers
